            I am a passionate developer with 1.5 years of experience in Web
            Development and Application Development, specialising in MERN and
            Android (Kotlin). My journey has been marked by both achievements
            and a commitment to continuous learning. Beyond my core development
            skills, I have a keen interest in Data Science, driven by the
            endless possibilities it offers.
